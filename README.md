# Linux ETL Pipeline

This project demonstrates an ETL pipeline built in an Ubuntu environment designed to process transaction data with standard command-line utilities. It emphasizes the power and flexibility of shell scripting and tools such as scp, bunzip2, awk, and other core Unix utilites to extract compressed files, clean and transform data, and generate practical reports.
